# Fast AArch64 PS3 Emulation on Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

Technical notes for making this emulator fast on Thor. `AGENTS.md` is the
operating contract; this file is the hardware knowledge behind it.

## The machine

Ayn Thor, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (`kalama`), 8 cores in a 1+2+2+3 layout:

| MIDR | core | count | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0xd4e` | Cortex-X3 | 1 | wide OoO, 4 vector pipes |
| `0xd4d` | Cortex-A715 | 2 | |
| `0xd47` | Cortex-A710 | 2 | |
| `0xd46` | Cortex-A510 | 3 | narrow, shared vector unit per pair |

`/proc/cpuinfo` Features, verified on device:

```
fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32 atomics fphp asimdhp cpuid asimdrdm
jscvt fcma lrcpc dcpop sha3 sm3 sm4 asimddp sha512 asimdfhm dit uscat ilrcpc
flagm ssbs sb paca pacg dcpodp flagm2 frint i8mm bf16 bti
```

**There is no SVE or SVE2.** Armv9 cores normally imply it, but Qualcomm does
not expose it here. This is the single biggest trap in this codebase: any LLVM
CPU name from the Armv9 family turns SVE on by default, and SVE codegen on this
device is unselectable. `sanitize_android_arm64_llvm_cpu` in
`util/JITLLVM.cpp` exists solely to catch that and fall back to `cortex-a78`.
Upstream's two SVE commits (`4a92d96cf`, `6349ea2ee`) must never be ported.

## What the JIT tells LLVM

`jit_compiler` sets `mcpu=cortex-a78` plus an explicit attribute list. On device
the line reads:

```
JIT: LLVM AArch64 target: cpu=cortex-a78 triple=aarch64-unknown-linux-android
     attrs=+sha3,+dotprod,+i8mm,-sve,-sve2
```

`cortex-a78` is Armv8.2, so `lse`, `rdm`, `crc`, `fp16` come implied. Anything
newer than v8.2 does **not**, even though the device has it: `lrcpc`, `flagm`,
`flagm2`, `frint`, `fcma`, `sha512`. Adding a feature to that list is free when
it is gated on the matching `utils::has_*()` and paired with an explicit
negative for hosts without it, which is the pattern `+sha3`/`-sha3` follows.

AOT code is built `-march=armv8.2-a -mtune=cortex-a715`. Atomics are real
inline LSE, confirmed by zero `__aarch64_cas*` / `__aarch64_ldadd*` undefined
symbols in the built objects, so there is no outline-atomics tax to remove.

## Feature to instruction to use-case

What the translators already exploit, so nobody re-derives it:

| feature | instruction | where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asimddp` | `SDOT`/`UDOT` | SPU `SUMB`; SPU `GB` bit-gather via a shift-and-sum constant |
| `i8mm` | `SMMLA`/`UMMLA` | SPU multiply widening |
| `sha3` | `BCAX` | SPU `EQV`, and both `SHUFB` selector paths |
| — | `TBL`/`TBX`, `TBL2`/`TBX2` | SPU `SHUFB`, `ROTQBY` family, PPU `VPERM` |
| — | `UABD` | SPU block-verification checksum |
| — | `USHL` | `inf_shl`/`inf_lshr`, dodging an LLVM poison-value pessimization |
| — | `CNT` | SPU `CNTB` via `ctpop` |
| — | `ADDV`/`ADDP` | SPU reductions |

## How to verify a codegen change actually landed

Three levels, cheapest first:

1. **Source contract test.** `tools/test_thor_spu_arm64_bcax_lowering.ps1` is
   the model: pin detection, the JIT attribute, the runtime gate, the fallback
   arithmetic, and every call site, so a regression fails on the host.
2. **Backend selection.** Feed the exact IR to NDK clang at the target the JIT
   uses (`-mcpu=cortex-a78+sha3`) and read the assembly. Also compile it
   *without* the feature: if it fails with `Cannot select`, the runtime gate is
   load-bearing rather than decorative.
3. **On device.** The SPU native object cache key hashes the optimized IR plus
   target identity, so a codegen change invalidates stale objects by
   construction. Boot, pull
   `.../BLUS30161/ppu-*/spu-native-v2`, and disassemble with NDK
   `llvm-objdump`. Count the instruction you expect **and** the sequence it was
   meant to replace.

When counting, match two-source `tbx v.16b, { v.16b, v.16b }` as well as
two-source `tbl`. Our `SHUFB` path emits `TBX2`; a `tbl`-only sweep reads as a
false negative and cost hours once.

## Traps that have already cost time

- **The thermal guard trips on a launch transient.** Launch reads `56.6 C` at
  `t=4s` and falls to `46.6 C` by `t=10s`. The harness samples into that spike
  and confirms on an immediate re-read, which force-stopped fifteen consecutive
  runs at `14-30 s` on heat the device never sustained. A run reporting
  `66-71 C` while the emulator overlay reads `Total : 22.7 %` is a tripped
  guard, not an emulation-bound run.
- **The panel's anti-image-retention overlay lands on top of runs.** It engages
  when the display sits static, which any cooldown guarantees, and it survives
  into the next run, so visual gates classify noise. Sleep the panel while
  waiting.
- **FPS is only drawn, never logged.** `overlay_perf_metrics.cpp` renders it
  top-left. A capture screenshot is therefore a measurement; open one before
  trusting any gate boolean.
- **Do not port an upstream ARM tuning fix without checking whether this fork
  already compensated.** Upstream's `busy_wait` scaling dropped Thor to ~1 FPS
  because every call site had already been retuned for the real `19.2 MHz`
  timer; two fixes for one problem multiply.
- **`TBL2`/`TBX2` need a retry owner.** They can trip the AArch64 register
  scavenger. The SPU block compiler has `compile_spu_llvm_with_retry`; the SPU
  interpreter builder deliberately does not, and stays on the plain path.

## Where the rest of this lives

These notes outgrew a single file. The detail is split by topic; each document
stands on its own and this file is the map.

| document | what is in it |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/arm64/codegen.md`](docs/arm64/codegen.md) | Instruction selection: the per-core optimization guides and what they say about the lowerings chosen here, the missing movemask, the SPU opcode audit, and the x86-habit table that produced most of the real defects. |
| [`docs/arm64/memory-model.md`](docs/arm64/memory-model.md) | Atomics and ordering: the dead LSE2 macro, the reservation seqlock, RCsc versus RCpc, and instruction-cache maintenance. |
| [`docs/arm64/power-and-thermal.md`](docs/arm64/power-and-thermal.md) | The thermal sensor mistakes, the hot retry loops, the WFE power-optimized wait, and what has actually been measured on device. |
| [`docs/arm64/ledger.md`](docs/arm64/ledger.md) | The audit ledger: every `ARCH_X64` block accounted for, the open opportunities, and the subsystems that needed nothing. |
| [`docs/hardware/`](docs/hardware/) | Arm's Cortex-X3 and A710 optimization guides, vendored, plus how to read their tables. |

`AGENTS.md` is the operating contract. This file is the hardware knowledge behind
it.

## Two things that outrank everything else here

**Nothing in these notes was measured against a running game.** Almost every
claim is about correctness, instruction counts, or hardware capability. Whether
any of it makes a title run faster is unknown, and the changes most likely to
matter in practice were never about instruction selection at all: custom GPU
drivers going from never-loading to working, and i-cache maintenance that a stale
fetch would have turned into an unreproducible crash.

**The recurring failure mode is a measurement that is correct and still supports
the wrong decision.** It has happened at least four times: a junction temperature
compared against a package-shaped limit, a thermal A/B that was really detecting
which cores an arm ran on, a WFE experiment whose two arms sampled different
cutscenes, and a BCAX microbenchmark whose chain forwarded within one region
where the real code crosses two. In each case the number was real and the
inference was not. When a result decides something, check that the thing measured
is the thing that ships.
