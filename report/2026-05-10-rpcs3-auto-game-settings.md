# 2026-05-10 RPCS3 Automatic Game Settings Notes

## What Exists Upstream

RPCS3 now has a config database flow that is much better than asking users to copy Wiki settings by hand.

The current upstream implementation uses `https://api.rpcs3.net/config/?api=v1`, not a live Wiki scrape in the emulator UI. RPCS3 packaging scripts download that endpoint into `bin/GuiConfigs/config_database.dat`. The Qt-side `config_database` reader loads `config_database.dat`, checks `return_code`, reads `games`, and validates each `games[TITLEID].config` string as a normal RPCS3 YAML config snippet.

At boot, RPCS3 retrieves a title-ID match and applies the database config on top of the active config path. If a custom per-game config exists, upstream intentionally leaves the custom config alone and ignores the database config for that game.

Primary upstream references:

- RPCS3 CI packaging downloads `config_database.dat`: <https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/blob/cd7cb1cc11fdcae484fc6b2d447be96e045fed1b/.ci/deploy-windows.sh#L15-L17>

- RPCS3 JSON/YAML validation path: <https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/blob/cd7cb1cc11fdcae484fc6b2d447be96e045fed1b/rpcs3/rpcs3qt/config_database.cpp#L139-L224>

## Android Integration

This fork now has an Android-side manager at `app/src/main/java/net/rpcsx/config/GameSettingsDatabase.kt`.

The manager does four practical things:

1. Loads the bundled RPCS3 config database from APK assets.
2. Seeds and reads a writable local cache at `config/GuiConfigs/config_database.dat` under the RPCSX root, matching the upstream desktop filename/location pattern.
3. Shows a plain `Recommended Settings` switch on the game detail screen when a title ID matches the database.
4. Writes a managed per-game config to `config/custom_configs/config_TITLEID.yml` before launch.

The local cache is the source of truth once it exists and validates. Startup only replaces it when the cache is missing, invalid, or older than the bundled APK snapshot. The game detail card has a refresh icon that downloads the current RPCS3 config API into that same local cache, so settings can update without waiting for a new APK while still working offline.

Managed files start with:

```yaml
# RPCSX_THOR_AUTO_SETTINGS
```

That header matters. If a user already has a custom config without that header, the fork does not overwrite it. User-created game configs win, just like upstream RPCS3 treats custom configs as higher priority than database configs.

## UX Rule

Do not expose this to normal users as "database config." The user-facing concept is:

```text
Recommended Settings
```

The switch defaults on for games with a matching title ID. Turning it off removes only this fork's managed config file and records a per-game opt-out.

## Remaining Risk

The Android UI can create the same custom config file shape RPCS3 expects, but the final effect still depends on the loaded RPCSX core honoring `config/custom_configs/config_TITLEID.yml` for Android boots. If the current native library does not load per-game custom configs in Android mode, the next core/API task is to add a direct boot mode or native export for database/custom config selection.

This is still the right first step because it gives the APK a bundled database, a simple game-level toggle, and a safe no-overwrite policy before deeper core changes.
