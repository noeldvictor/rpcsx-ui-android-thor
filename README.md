Personal-use Android fork of RPCSX-UI-Android for **AYN Thor Base, Pro, and Max**. It is vibe-coded with AI assistance, tuned around Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / Adreno 740 Thor hardware, and meant to move fast toward a simpler handheld PS3 experience.

No stability guarantee. No support queue. No big download button. Do not open issues expecting upstream-style triage. Fork it, build it, change it, and use legally owned dumps with legally obtained firmware.

## Quick Read

- **Target:** AYN Thor Base / Pro / Max. Thor Lite may run it, but is not the PS3 performance target.
- **Purpose:** easier library setup, better Thor controls, visible cheats, visible cache status, and Thor-specific performance experiments.
- **Release style:** source-first. GitHub Actions artifacts may exist, but this README intentionally points people toward forking/building.
- **AI note:** this is openly AI-assisted and experimental. Rough edges are expected.
- **Upstream:** still GPLv2, still based on RPCSX-UI-Android, still dependent on RPCSX core behavior.

## Thor Variants

Base, Pro, and Max share the same CPU/GPU target. The main difference is cache/storage headroom.

| Variant | CPU/GPU | RAM | Storage | Practical note |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Thor Base | Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / Adreno 740 | 8 GB | 128 GB | Same speed target, tightest cache budget. |
| Thor Pro | Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / Adreno 740 | 12 GB | 256 GB | Default comfort target. |
| Thor Max | Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / Adreno 740 | 16 GB | 1 TB | Best cache/library headroom. |

## User-Facing Differences

Plain version: upstream is the general Android app; this fork is the Thor handheld experiment.

| Area | This fork changes |
| --- | --- |
| Updates | Upstream-style update nags are disabled for this fork. |
| Library setup | External PS3 folders and ISOs can be added with SD-card use in mind. |
| Titles and covers | Reads `PARAM.SFO` and `ICON0.PNG` from PS3 game folders/ISOs where possible. |
| Cheats | Adds cheat badges, per-game cheat lists, bundled cheat database work, and simple toggles. |
| In-game menu | Adds Thor-friendly Cheats, Fast Forward 2x, Show FPS, Save State, and Load State paths. |
| Hotkeys | `Select + R1` fast-forward, `Select + right stick down` save, `Select + right stick up` load. |
| Back button | Android Back opens the in-game menu during gameplay and pauses. |
| Touch overlay | Thor defaults to hidden on-screen controls because it has physical controls. |
| Sixaxis | Thor motion sensors are wired for PS3 motion when the bundled core exposes the bridge. |
| Recommended settings | Per-game settings can be enabled with one simple switch. |
| Compiled cache | Game detail shows PPU, SPU, and shader cache status instead of hiding it. |
| Cache storage | Internal or app-owned SD-card compiled-cache storage can be selected when Android exposes both. |
| Trim / Optimize | Experimental personal-use trimming tools are visible in the app. |
| GPU drivers | Driver UI is Thor-guided with Adreno 740 notes and curated Turnip-style sources. |
| Debugging | Thor log/screenshot capture scripts are included for reproducible play-session debugging. |

## Technical Differences

- RPCSX core source is vendored under `app/src/main/cpp/rpcsx`, so Android UI and Thor core experiments live in one repo.
- The default Gradle APK bundles this fork's source-built RPCSX core unless `-PbuildBundledRpcsxCore=false` is passed.
- Fork update prompts are disabled through `BuildConfig.FORK_BUILD=true`.
- Cheat work includes bundled database assets, Artemis/Aldos conversion experiments, RPCS3 patch imports, and patch-hash learning.
- Recommended settings use a bundled RPCS3 config snapshot plus a writable local cache.
- Per-game compiled-cache status reads `cache/cache/TITLEID` and counts PPU, SPU, and RSX shader cache entries.
- RSX shader cache lives below the PPU cache tree (`.../ppu-*/shaders_cache/`), so selected compiled-cache storage covers CPU and shader cache together.
- Thor defaults cap LLVM compile workers, disable full first-boot PPU precompile, enable SPU and on-disk shader cache, and use a Thor-safe `cortex-a78` LLVM target.
- The old Android `cortex-a34` startup override is removed because it silently downgrades Thor JIT codegen.
- Fast Forward 2x uses RPCSX/RPCS3 `Clocks scale`, not raw uncapped rendering.
- System Info includes an early `Thor Feature Doctor` readout for LLVM CPU, detected AArch64 cores, and Android feature flags.
- Android-side performance cleanup has started: less main-thread file probing, faster folder scan queues, safer large-file copy, cached patch status reads, and debounced library saves.

The connected Thor reports `kalama` hardware and this CPU layout from `/proc/cpuinfo`:

| CPU | Part | Interpreted core |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `0xd46` | Cortex-A510 |
| 1 | `0xd46` | Cortex-A510 |
| 2 | `0xd46` | Cortex-A510 |
| 3 | `0xd4d` | Cortex-A715 |
| 4 | `0xd4d` | Cortex-A715 |
| 5 | `0xd47` | Cortex-A710 |
| 6 | `0xd47` | Cortex-A710 |
| 7 | `0xd4e` | Cortex-X3 |

Useful masks for native/core experiments:

| Group | CPUs | Mask |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Efficiency only | `0-2` | `0x07` |
| A715 only | `3-4` | `0x18` |
| A710 only | `5-6` | `0x60` |
| Prime X3 only | `7` | `0x80` |
| Performance plus prime | `3-7` | `0xF8` |
| A715 plus prime | `3-4,7` | `0x98` |

Practical direction: keep PPU/SPU/shader caches on internal storage when possible, cap LLVM compile workers before heat and memory pressure snowball, and expose obvious Thor controls instead of making users dig through advanced settings.

## Building

Requirements: Android SDK, JDK 17, Android 10+ target device.

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

Debug APK:

```text
app\build\outputs\apk\debug\rpcsx-thor-experiment-debug.apk
```

The default build compiles the Android JNI wrapper and bundles this fork's source-built RPCSX core. Hydrate pinned RPCSX third-party submodules once before the first full source-core build:

```powershell
.\tools\hydrate_rpcsx_core_deps.ps1
```

For faster UI-only iteration:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug -PbuildBundledRpcsxCore=false
```

## Thor Debug Capture

Live stream while playing:

```powershell
.\tools\start_thor_debug_stream.ps1 -ClearLogcat -Launch -Label game-name
.\tools\summarize_thor_debug_stream.ps1 -Latest
.\tools\stop_thor_debug_stream.ps1 -Latest
```

One-shot capture:

```powershell
.\tools\collect_thor_debug.ps1 -Label game-name
```

Debug streams and captures are written to ignored `debug-captures/` folders.

## License

This fork keeps the upstream GPLv2 license unless a directory or file contains its own license.
